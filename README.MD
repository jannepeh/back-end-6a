## Enhanced Security Practices

We implemented the following security best practices to ensure the application is secure:

1. **Password Hashing with bcrypt**:

   - User passwords are hashed before storing them in the database.
   - Passwords are compared securely during authentication using bcrypt.

2. **Helmet**:

   - Adds secure HTTP headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and clickjacking.

3. **CORS**:

   - Restricts cross-origin requests to trusted origins, improving the security of API interactions.

4. **Rate Limiting**:

   - Limits the number of requests per client IP to mitigate brute force and DDoS attacks.

5. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:

   - Validates user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other malicious payloads.
   - Sanitizes inputs for secure database queries.

6. **HTTPS**:
   - Enforces secure, encrypted communication between the server and clients.
